Just like in climbing, it is hard to tell what is difficult without some sort of rating for newbies.  I could just focus on the ones I can work on at work.  If they are for work, they are a project and I can get paid to learn to code.  That would be ideal.  If it is going to take me a week, it better if it is something I can do at work.  Anything I learn can still be used for other projects."
